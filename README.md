## Meme
This is for [this meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/vhga6q/python_foot_mat_specially_designed_to_suit/)

### Why is the foot class and absorb method so weird
Because in the meme they do `absorb(foot[n].water)` which, if `water` is just a value, then it won't change the value in the `foot` class. 

### Setup
Have python 3.9+

### Run
`python3 ./main.py`
